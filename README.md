Project Steps

1. Data Wrangling
Task: Cleaned and pre-processed the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
Steps:
Identified missing values and imputed them appropriately.
Removed duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy.
Converted relevant columns into usable formats for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Programming Language Trends

Analysis: Identified the top 10 programming languages used and desired by respondents.
Visualization:
Bar charts for current and future trends.
Findings: High demand for Python, JavaScript, and Java both currently and for future learning.
Database Trends

Analysis: Compared the most commonly used databases with the ones developers aim to learn.
Visualization:
Bar charts showcasing top 10 databases.
Findings: SQL-based databases remain highly popular, with MongoDB gaining traction for future learning.
Demographics

Analysis: Examined respondent distribution by age, education level, and country.
Visualization:
Pie charts for age groups and education levels.
